            <p>With you between my arms</p>
            <p>Barefoot on the grass</p>
            <p>Listening to our favourite song</p>
            <p>When you said you looked a mess</p>
            <p>I whispered underneath my breath</p>
            <p>But you heard it</p>
            <p>Darling, you look perfect tonight</p></li>

        <li><p>Well, I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know</p>
            <p>She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home</p>
            <p>I found a lover, to carry more than just my secrets</p>
            <p>To carry love, to carry children of our own</li></p>

        <p><li>We are still kids, but we're so in love</p>
            <p>Fighting against all odds</p>
            <p>I know we'll be alright this time</p>
            <p>Darling, just hold my hand</p>
            <p> my girl, I'll be your man</p>
            <p>I see my future in your eyes</li></p>

            <p> With you between my arms</p>
            <p>Barefoot on the grass</p>
            <p>Listening to our favorite song</p>
            <p>When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful</p>
            <p>I don't deserve this</p>
            <p>Darling, you look perfect tonight</p></li>

            <p>I have faith in what I see</p>
            <p>Now I know I have met an angel in person</p>
            <p>And she looks perfect</p></li>
